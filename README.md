- Problem Statement
    - Consider a company's marketing campaign (Arvato Financial Services), in which we need to select those individuals who can become the company's future customers. For this task, we have the following databases: demographic information from Germany (country where the company is located) and information from individuals who are already customers of this company.
  - We used unsupervised machine learning algorithms to analyze the market and segment it, selecting the main characteristics that can best describe the company's consumer.
  - Then, we used this information to create a predictive model that can determine with reasonable precision whether an individual can be a likely consumer or not, when subjected to a particular marketing campaign.
  - In addition, we developed a web service so that, when introducing characteristics of a certain person, the service responds if the individual will become a potential consumer.
